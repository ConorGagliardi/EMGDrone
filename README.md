# EMGDrone
Worked on a novel UAV control scheme using human gestures captured through electromyography (EMG) and inertial measurement unit (IMU) data. Developed and tested different machine learning classifiers, with an emphasis on real-time gesture classification accuracy.

Please look at the EMGDrone.pdf for research paper, and media folder for presentation and demos.
